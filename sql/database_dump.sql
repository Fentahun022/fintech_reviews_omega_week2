9e6b8e08-8acf-4e1f-a179-a5a703ff2ebc	1	The CBE app has been highly unreliable in recent weeks. It frequently fails to work properly on both Ethio Telecom and Safaricom networks, whether using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This week, the system was down entirely for extended periods, making it very difficult to access banking services. The app only functions intermittently, and the lack of consistency is frustrating. I hope the issues are addressed soon, and that any non-technical influences are removed from such essential services.	2	2025-05-25	NEGATIVE	0.999761760	Account Access Issues, Bugs & Reliability, User Interface & Experience

Worse is tbe download button putting a copy of the screenshot - which you prevented to be taken - in tbe downloads folder where we cant attach directly from Whatsapp. Millions of people use the screenshot as proof of payment / transfer yet you make that harder for everyone?

Learn from telebire app and give options to customers to apt out of this ridiculous security feature.

For instance the transaction history you see on top is one made a couple of months ago and you have to refresh until you reach the top. it's just so bizarre.

Another thing I would like to comment on is that the current method for transferring money to Telebir can own be sent to the person. So, it is possible to send money directly from the Commercial Bank to other banks.

And there customer service workers told me it will be returned in to my cbe account after 3 or 5 working days if its not credited in to my telebirr account. How's that working?

8542d4c5-ec4e-4720-9a82-df371badc73d	1	The CBE mobile banking app is a time-saver, but it needs several improvements, like adding fingerprint authentication. It's risky when people see me entering my PIN. Additionally, the fees are unreasonable. You could learn from Tele Birr, which adjusts fees based on the transaction amount. However, the CBEMB app charges a flat 10 birr fee for amounts between 5 and 1000 birr, which I think is unfair.	2	2024-09-04	NEGATIVE	0.998902440	Feature Requests, Transaction Performance

However, I would like to suggest a future modification: currently, the app only displays transactions for one month.

Please dear CBE IT department , when user searches for help it is to get assistance not to give money. What you named help other banks call "Charity" "Donate" etc. And yes users need HELP.

c8be1099-bd82-4f88-a6a4-98516e5a1bee	1	Shame to see one of the biggest bank in east africa. Have this app 1 .you try to send money.. it will fail on the way you try again and your money have been sent Twice. Then you have to ask the Receiver to send the money back to you. 2. Try to refresh to see your recent transaction and it will show old transaction. Clearly they don't care . You can get your statement easily via telebirr. But cbe you have to go to branch and beg sometimes Bribe the managers to get your own bank statement . Shame	1	2023-11-23	NEGATIVE	0.999474108	Feature Requests, Transaction Performance

a662acd2-c894-4fbe-a5f7-091bf2fd1be0	1	In fact, it's a good app to make our daily life easier! However, I have encountered several times issues with this app. 1. It's not always working with network error, even though the network is good on my phone. 2. It happened to me several times that when I transfer money to someone's account, I doubled the transfer! Or in another word, my money sent two times. If I wanted to send 10,000, I found that sent 20,000 because of the APP error.

When someone changes a phone, it makes it mandatory to consult the branch and that makes it not to be self assisted. Hope you could fix it. Please add an option of transferring to other TeleBirr numbers other than the "Own telebirr" option.

Every time CBE does small patches or updates, the app doesn't work and you have to go to your branch in person to get the update and verification on your phone. It is totally unacceptable. I am living abroad and because of their problems I can't make payments and transfers. I send my representative("·â∞·ãà·ä´·ã≠") to Addis Ababa Branch with his full-representation paper ("·àô·àâ ·ãç·ä≠·àç·äì") but the staff working at mobile banking services is not willing to fix the problem.	1	2023-01-06	NEGATIVE	0.999795616	Account Access Issues, Bugs & Reliability, Feature Requests, Transaction Performance

It should allow to see all Transactions by Tracing Back. No Need to Limit it with only one Page Transaction (May be 10Page). 2. You have to Work on transferring Money to other Banks too.

But bugs still abound. It worked from outside Ethiopia but not for long. I haven't been able to use it (from outside Ethiopia) for the past 4 weeks. No updates visible. Nothing against the country that I dearly love. But this app is the one-eyed version as far as banking apps go.

5c93655e-e7c7-4467-887e-703513adfc36	1	I have been using this app for almost four years now. In the beginning, it was working fine. Sometime later, it gets difficult to create a connection to my account, and could not manage to make and see transactions on my account. After updating it lately, Jul 2020, I was glad this app came with some user interface improvements, and the connection was quite fast. Not longer than two weeks, the app starts to get stuck, and it cannot even show me the UI properly. As a result, I have a useless app on my cell phone, hoping that [you] will soon come with updates.	2	2020-09-03	NEGATIVE	0.999382019	Feature Requests, Transaction Performance, User Interface & Experience

Why is it every time a user forgots his/her pin,they had to go to their branch? it's very frustrating and not expected from a banking app of such a giant bank.Secondly,the "Accounts" and "Recents" sub menus at the bottom have exactly the same features	2	2020-08-02	NEGATIVE	0.996593773	Account Access Issues, Feature Requests, Transaction Performance, User Interface & Experience
baa7bd9e-79b8-4af7-9b9c-478091559a88	1	I love it so much for its nice user interface and massive improvement. One much important thing it lacks is that, it synchronizes #ONLY-ONE account per app. For this reason, people (customers) who had >/= 2 accounts for different reasons, are obliged to visit the local CBE branch, which is unadvisable especially during COVID-19 era. I hope you will do your best on it.	4	2020-08-02	POSITIVE	0.843257964	User Interface & Experience

The other thing if possible to add would be to expand the number of transaction be looked for all transaction back to a month period at list this will help review most transactions if there needs any review. The only problem I saw is that once a phone number is attached to another bank account # you need to provide another phone number to get the service.

The App asks repeatedly to switch off developer options, even if it is switched off. 3. Bank of Abyssinia's services are interesting, but they ignored the issues on the App service. 4. Most customers gave a complain on the App, but no one accept their complain to fix the issue. 5.

This is a huge gap that I observed in BOA mobile banking. I didn't experience this kind of challenge while having transactions in other banks' mobile banking platforms. After waiting so long, I called your customer support team and the response they gave me was "it was the system that holds the transaction & will be released on working days".

The loading animated icon has white irregular edges because the logo wasn't cut out correctly. The app doesn't work at all. It doesn't even login. It gets stuck on login just showing the logo animation and blames the issue on connectivity.
